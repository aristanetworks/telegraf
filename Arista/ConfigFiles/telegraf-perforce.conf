  ## The target database for metrics (telegraf will create it if not exists).

  ## Retention policy to write to.

  ## Precision of writes, valid values are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  ## note: using "s" precision greatly improves InfluxDB compression.

  ## Write timeout (for the InfluxDB client), formatted as a string.
  ## If not provided, will default to 5s. 0s means no timeout (not recommended).
